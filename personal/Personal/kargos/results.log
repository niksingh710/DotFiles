This test run on 15/04/22 at 19:35:39 on host Linux lappy 5.13.0-39-generic
#44-Ubuntu SMP Thu Mar 24 15:35:05 UTC 2022 x86_64.

Command: "fwts fan".
Running tests: fan.

fan: Simple fan tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: Test fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device1 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device11 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device8 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device6 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device4 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device14 of type TCC Offset has max cooling state 63
and current cooling state 4.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device2 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device12 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device0 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device10 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device9 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device7 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device5 of type Processor has max cooling state 10
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device3 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 0.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device11 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device8 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device6 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device12 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device10 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device9 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device7 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device5 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.
